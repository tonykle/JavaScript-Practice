# JavaScript Practice
JS code I have written over the last few months to solidify my understanding of fundamental JS concepts. I wrote most of these fairly quickly in order to experiment with JS and to better understand the language's quirks. I attempted to cover core JS concepts such as: prototypes, classes/objects, closure, currying, hoisting, 'this', and others. The vast majority of the implementations are trivial in nature.

If you would like to experiment with these files, follow the instructions below to do so:

1. Make sure git and node are installed on your machine

..* Mac users: You can check if they are installed by inputting```node -v``` and ```git --version``` into terminal
2. Clone this repository by navigating to where you want the repository to be and entering the following command ```git clone https://github.com/tonykle/JavaScript-Practice.git``` into terminal
3. Navigate to where the ```.js``` file is that you want to experiment with.
4. Input the command ```node filename.js``` into terminal.
