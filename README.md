# JavaScript Practice
JS code I have written over the last few months to solidify my understanding of fundamental JS concepts. I wrote most of these fairly quickly in order to experiment with JS and to better understand the language's quirks. I attempted to cover core JS concepts such as: prototypes, classes/objects, closure, currying, hoisting, 'this', and others. The vast majority of the implementations are trivial in nature.
