# JavaScript Practice
This repository contains JS code I have written over the last few months to solidify my understanding of fundamental JS concepts. I wrote most of these files in order to experiment with JS and to better understand the language's quirks. I attempted to cover core JS concepts such as: prototypes, classes/objects, closure, currying, hoisting, 'this', and others. The vast majority of the implementations are trivial in nature.

## Try it out yourself!

1. Make sure git and node are installed on your machine (Mac users: You can check if they are installed by inputting```node -v``` and ```git --version``` into terminal).
2. Clone this repository by navigating to where you want the repository to be and entering the following command ```git clone https://github.com/tonykle/JavaScript-Practice.git``` into terminal.
3. Navigate to where the ```.js``` file is that you want to experiment with.
4. Execute the file by inputting ```node filename.js``` into terminal.
