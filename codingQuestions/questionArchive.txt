~JavaScript coding questions that I've found via Glassdoor/Quora/random Google searches as asked by tech companies

FaceBook:
- Given two identical DOM trees (not the same one), and a node from one of them find the node in the other one.
- Flatten array. This array can have multiple types: , [], "", undefined, null, 123 are all valid types inside the array.
- Given a grid of characters output a decoded message. The message for the following would be IROCKA. (diagonally down
right and diagonally up right if you can't go further .. you continue doing this)
- If you were building a search tool and wanted search results to pop up as you typed but the server call was taxing, write a function
that gets called on every key down but calls the server when the user stops typing for 400ms.
- Given a node from a DOM tree find the node in the same position from an identical DOM tree.
- Given an input array and another array that describes a new index for each element, mutate the input array
so that each element ends up in their new index. Discuss the runtime of the algorithm and how you can be sure
there won't be any infinite loops.
- Implement a square root function.

Uber:
- Implement substring method
- Reverse words in string
